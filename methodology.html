How we collect, analyze, and report flower pricing data
⚠️ Important Notice
This data is compiled for informational and editorial purposes only. Prices shown are estimates based on market surveys and may not reflect current pricing at any specific florist. Actual prices vary by retailer, arrangement style, flower availability, and market conditions.
This website and its data are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any individual florist or floral industry organization unless explicitly stated.
Overview
The Flower Index Data project tracks Valentine's Day flower prices across 100 American cities to help consumers understand regional pricing variations and help journalists report on seasonal flower market trends.
This project is a collaboration between independent researchers and TeamFloral, a network of local florists who voluntarily share pricing information to promote market transparency.
Data Collection Methodology
Survey Period
Data is collected annually during the first two weeks of January, approximately 4-6 weeks before Valentine's Day. This timing captures pre-holiday pricing while allowing florists to finalize their Valentine's Day menus.
Sample Selection
Cities are selected based on a combination of:
	•	Population size (representing major metropolitan areas)
	•	Geographic distribution (ensuring regional coverage)
	•	Florist participation (cities with willing survey participants)
Price Data Collection
For each city, we collect pricing data through multiple methods:
	1	Direct florist surveys: Participating TeamFloral members report their standard pricing for common Valentine's arrangements.
	2	Published menu review: We review publicly available pricing from florist websites and published menus.
	3	Industry benchmarks: We cross-reference with industry publications and wholesale market data.
PRODUCTS SURVEYED
We track prices for standardized products: one dozen long-stem red roses (arranged in vase with filler greens) and a mixed seasonal bouquet (mid-range, approximately 12-15 stems). Prices include standard local delivery where available.
Calculated Metrics
City Rankings
Cities are ranked by the average price of one dozen red roses, from highest to lowest. Rankings reflect relative pricing only and do not indicate quality differences.
Generosity Score
The "Generosity Score" (0-100) is a composite metric that estimates how often residents purchase flowers for others relative to cost of living. It is calculated using:
	•	Local flower purchase frequency (survey-estimated)
	•	Average order value relative to local median income
	•	Frequency of delivery orders vs. in-store pickup
This metric is intended as a fun editorial element and should not be considered statistically rigorous.
Year-over-Year Change
Where historical data is available, we calculate the percentage change from the previous year's survey. First-year cities show estimated changes based on regional averages.
